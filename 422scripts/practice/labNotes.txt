Q:
When we confirm the multipage form data and there are errors on multiple pages do we only need to show an error message on the first page we redirect to? Or do we show error messages on future pages that also were the source of bad form data?
A: 
I'd redirect to the first page with the error, then if they go through the form and don't fix the other errors then redirect to the next error on the next run-through

lab 1 submission: one zip file, two .war, two src tree

Refer to examples for:
	ant build.xml
	servlets
	DAO/repo pattern
.

getservletcontext().log() prints to a localhost-${today}.log file
	in the corresponding tomcat/log dir. 
Then, 
	tail -f on the file. 
	tail -f file.log | grep  "DEBUG" 
shows log messages that start with debug

do DAO
So much for the repository patternâ€¦
overhead with DAO pattern
refer to ValueObject/DAOObject/etc
